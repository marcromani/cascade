# Cascade

Cascade is a C++ library designed for error propagation using automatic differentiation. It allows users to compute gradients of an expression and then use them to propagate uncertainties in the input to the output. This library simplifies the process of error analysis in scientific computing and engineering applications.

## Features

- Automatic differentiation: Cascade provides automatic differentiation capabilities to compute gradients efficiently.
- Error propagation: It allows for the propagation of uncertainties from input variables to output variables.
- User-friendly interface: The library offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy to integrate into existing C++ projects.
